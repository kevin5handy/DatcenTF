Type: College project
## Introduction

In Data Center, there are many IT equipments that can generate large amount of heat. The cooling system itself needs time to respond to spontaneous temperature changes. These things give two main problems:

1. Energy efficiency, response, which is hampered can cause the cooling system to use more power than needed.
2. Stability, sudden temperature changes can affect the performance and reliability of IT equipment.

The goal of this project is Developing a predictive model to predict cooling loads. The prediction results will be displayed on the monitor and always updated in real time. This project is expected to help optimize energy use and improve system stability.

## Method

1. Data Collecting: Using existing datasets to train the model. Real-time data will be taken from the server via MQTT connection for prediction needs.
2. Model Building: Developing a predictive model based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using several libraries such as TensorFlow, Numpy, Matplotlib, and others in python.
3. Model Deployment: Combining MQTT-based data collection, model prediction, and visualization into a python script.
4. Displaying prediction and actual graphs in real time.

## Result

As a result, a good ANN model was obtained in making predictions.
